# Baku Transportation Analysis 🚎🚲🗺️

This project consists of two main parts: **Bus Stop Analysis** and **Bike Lane Analysis** in Baku, Azerbaijan. The analyses focus on public transportation accessibility and bike infrastructure.

## 1. Bus Stop Analysis🚎🏫

### 1.1 Collecting Bus Stop Information
I collected bus stop data from **OpenStreetMap** using **OSMnx**.  

### 1.2 Collecting University Information
Educational institutions (universities, colleges, and lyceums) were also collected from OSMnx. Polygon campuses were converted to centroids for accurate distance calculation.  

### 1.3 Distance Analysis and Insights
I calculated the distance from each educational institution to the nearest bus stop.  
- Institutions located more than **500 meters** from a bus stop were identified.  
- **Insight:** These areas show where public transportation access could be improved for students, highlighting potential opportunities for better service coverage.

## 2. Bike Lane Analysis 🚲🗺️

### 2.1 Collecting Bike Lane Information
Bike lane data was collected from **OpenStreetMap data**.  

### 2.2 Loading Regions Dataset
District boundaries were loaded from **opendata.az** for spatial aggregation.  

### 2.3 Length Analysis and Insights
- Maximum bike lane length is in **Mardəkan**.  
- **Sabail District** has the longest total bike lanes.  
- One bike lane crosses **two districts**, showing inter-district connectivity.
